* Feature for the wrap about a literary background for the PAR/wrap → book Joe Corneli is reading where drivers check-in about how they’re doing

## Peeragogical Action Reviews

Pattern of Patterns → Which one would you like to fill in?

Forms for entering pattern and PAR: [https://groupware-systems.org/pattern-forms/](https://groupware-systems.org/pattern-forms/)

Where are things going that have been filled-in?

Maybe have a visual showing for dashboard of recent updates so you have an automated form? One web page pulling in `iframes`?
