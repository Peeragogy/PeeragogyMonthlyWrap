* Actionism - what happens when people lose interest following an initial excitement about a project?
* Writing up patterns is nice, but how are we using them? What software is using them?

Create solutions or software but they are not openly licensed or behind a pay wall - it is good for founders, but how can that help wider community? Is that a bad thing that interest of owners or founders diverge from community? Good thing? Inevitable? What are other approaches?
