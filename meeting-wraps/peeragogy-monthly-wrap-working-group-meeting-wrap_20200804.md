# “Peeragogy Monthly Wrap” Working Group Meeting Wrap: 2020-08-04

## 3 Practical Projects

### Monthly wrap

* Focus on making this accessible for people who haven’t been able to participate lately, so they can catch up with the project as a whole
* There is also meta data required about the wraps in order to more automatically generate them
* Do we want to have specific ones by month going forward? Or just have one entry catching up on the past few months?

### Wraps of the working group meetings

* Haven’t decided what to do with them
* Gets very meta, wrapping meetings where we’re talking about wraps, not necessarily accessible by all readers

### Peeragogical Action Reviews

* Stephan Kreutzer has been collecting them from many sources (documents, emails, etc.)
    - Tough to have them across multiple platforms
    - Be better to have a form or software tool to input them into an action review catalog
    - Have a way to print them, make cards, collect them into a catalogue, and have some sort of virtual table for looking at them
    - Have a meta review
    - Have a way to distribute them to people
    - Have a roadmap tool
    - Invite other people to create them? Write down instructions.
    - In PARs, people quickly tend to put in other structure and information that isn’t covered by the PAR semantics/format
    - Add a new question as the last one asking about next steps, connecting between PARs and on the roadmap for an ongoing activity and review process, if PAR isn’t used as a one-off standalone tool for a single action? Look back to see if action actually occurred or not?
