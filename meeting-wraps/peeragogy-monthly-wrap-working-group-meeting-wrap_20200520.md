# “Peeragogy Monthly Wrap” Working Group Meeting Wrap: 2020-05-20

## Patterns

* Create template and repository for patterns
* Pattern template could be used to create cards, games, a catalog, etc.
* Scenario: at an unconference, you could introduce patterns as a tool (not that they necessarily need to be used, more of a toolbox to choose from)
* Make it easier to apply them, like a pattern practice
* Universal tools that can be used on all kinds of patterns
* PAR itself should be a pattern

Why do you need patterns? Answer: They should be used/applied. Patterns for architecture exist for being used in the field (for planning and constructing buildings). Other patterns, for example some textile coloring patterns, may only serve the purpose of being nice to look at.

## Roadmap

* General roadmap tool that could be in its own repository so you could see the current situation and future directions
* Every two months a reminder to see if roadmap is outdated?
* Or offering it for mapping if a project doesn’t have a roadmap?
* If you don’t have a methodological or tool way to do this, it’s down to discpline and harder within unstrucutured peer learning scenario

## PAR

PAR should have a naming convention so you could have more than one in a month and software would be able to organize them. PARs could flow automatically into wrap. Same with mixtape.
